Docker version 18.09

1) WHat is your experience on Docker?

Basically, I would like to say that in the docker, i have created the various kinds of docker files and I have built continous from scratch and apart from that i ahve also got experience in utilisation of the kubernetes for the orchestration of the docker container
runs across multiple machines and i have been using docker fro deployment of various microservices and services across various namespaces on the cloud and a person that a I am also responsible in the current project for integrating with the elastic container registry
so that we can goahead and post the containers to elastic container service i would like to say and i ahve also the microservice written in java spring boot and the node JS on the cloud which i was actually using for the various kinds of scaling up on the cloud 

2) What is Docker, container, image?

Docker:
	Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running the applications
	Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.
	With docker you can manage your infrastructure in the same way you manage your applications
	
	Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as "containerization".
	
container:
its a runtime instance of an image that shares the kernel of host machine. Its runs as discrete process.
It runs natively on linux and shares the kernel with other containers

image:
Its an executable package that contains everything needed (libraries, code, environment variables, config files) to run an application.

3) Docker Architecture:

	The Docker Deemon is the service that runs on your host operating system
	The Docker Deamon itself exposed a REST API. From here a number of different tools can talk to the daemon through API.
	The Docker CLI, it is a command line tool that lets you talk to the Docker daemon

4) How does the docker machine created in amazon cloud?

Basically docker machine is getting created, will actually have various kinds of docker images which are the elastic container registry and then we will be pulling that image from the remote elastic container registry and then we will be running the command called

Docker run -ti ubuntu/centos

We will also try to scale up the kubernetes as well as the docker swarm and it can be used for the production and various kinds stuff on top of that.


5) how do you secure docker demon?
Secure by default
If you want to secure your Docker client connections by default, you can move the files to the .docker directory in your home directory -- and set the DOCKER_HOST and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY variables as well (instead of passing-H=tcp://$HOST:2376 and --tlsverify on every call).
$ mkdir -pv ~/.docker $ cp -v {ca,cert,key}.pem ~/.docker  $ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$HOST:2376 DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1


7) What is the hirerachy in Docker?
	Stack
		services
			Containers
8) Where is Docker config file located?
	its available in /etc/docker/daemon.json

9) How to set a DNS address?
	Add following line to docker config file.
	{
		"dns": ["your_dns_address", "8.8.8.8"]
	}
	
	Note:	Always make sure to restart Docker after updating config file.
	
10) How to specify if you use a proxy server for connecting?
	Proxy servers can block connections to your web app once it’s up and running. If you are behind a proxy server, add the following lines to your Dockerfile.
	Use ENV command and specify the Host and Port in the docker file.
	# Set proxy server, replace host:port with values for your servers
		ENV http_proxy host:port
		ENV https_proxy host:port

11) What is docker registry? & repository?
	A registry is a collection of repositories, and a repository is a collection of images

12) How do you setup your Private Registery?
	Using Docker Trusted Regsitry, you can setup your own registry for storing images.

13) How many repositories you can create in a Registry?
	Unlimited

14) What is the registry used by docker?
	Docker uses Docker's public registry by default
	
15) How do you scale & perform load balancing on your applications?
	This is achieved using the concept of Services in docker. A higher level than Container.
	
16) How do you scale your app?
	Simply update the docker-compose.yml and re-run the docker stack deploy command

17) Explain the docker file by taking sample image of your microservice?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Dockerfile:

What is a docker file?
Portable images are defined by something called a "Dockerfile"
Dockerfile contains the information about your container environment such as Files, Network, Storage Volumes etc.

So Basically in that docker file, the first step is pull the base image which is Ubuntu Image and from there you will be having the various run directives which are there which can actually have the command used for the installation of the stuff and also you will 
be having other things like exposing the ports and then that command and all the other things for that case and also will be having various commands nad the entry point which will be used for this case.


Create an empty directory on your local machine. Change directories (cd) into the new directory, create a file called Dockerfile, copy-and-paste the following content into that file, and save it. Take note of the comments that explain each statement in your new Dockerfile.
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:2.7-slim

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

2) docker-compose.yml:

What is Docker Compose?
	Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. 
	Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration


Save this file as docker-compose.yml wherever you want. Be sure you have pushed the image you created in Part 2 to a registry, and update this .yml by replacing username/repo:tag with your image details.
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    # replace username/repo:tag with your name and image details
    image: username/repo:tag
    deploy:
      replicas: 5
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: "0.1"
          memory: 50M
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure
    ports:
      - "4000:80"
    networks:
      - webnet

Docker Swarm:

what is docker swarm?

	A swarm is nothing but a  group of machine running docker grouped into a cluster. We will have a Swarm manager on a node, which will interact with other docker machines and create containers for your app.
	All the managing is done through Swarm Manager, and swarm is a tool for container orchestartion.
	
1) Swarm setup:

	docker swarm init   to enable swarm mode and make your current machine a swarm manager
	docker swarm join   on other machines to have them join the swarm as workers.

2) Create Cluster:

 docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
 docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm2
 
3) INITIALIZE THE SWARM AND ADD NODES:

The first machine acts as the manager, which executes management commands and authenticates workers to join the swarm, and the second is a worker.

$ docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>"
Swarm initialized: current node <node ID> is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

  docker swarm join \
  --token <token> \
  <myvm ip>:<port>

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager'

4) Deploy your app on the swarm cluster:

Now that you have myvm1, you can use its powers as a swarm manager to deploy your app by using the same docker stack deploy.

docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker life cycle:

1) Create a container to run it later on with required image.
docker create --name <container-name> <image-name
2) Run the docker container with the required image and specified command / process. ‘-d’ flag is used for running the container in background.
docker run -it -d --name <container-name> <image-name> bash
3) Pause container to pause the processes running inside the container.
docker pause <container-id/name>
4) Unpause container to unpause the processes inside the container.
docker unpause <container-id/name>
5)Start container to start the container, if present in stopped state.
docker start <container-id/name>
6) Stop container to stop the container and processes running inside the container:
docker stop <container-id/name>
7) Restart container to restart the container as well as processes running inside the container.
docker restart <container-id/name>
8) Kill container to kill the running container.
docker kill <container-id/name>
9) Destroy container Its preferred to destroy container, only if present in stopped state instead of forcefully destroying the running container.
docker rm <container-id/name>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secure Docker Container:

1) Always make sure to start Docker containers with the -u flag so that they run as an ordinary user instead of root. This is a basic first step toward improving security.
2) Taking the previous point a step further, remove SUID flags from your container images. This makes privilege escalation attacks even harder.
3) Configure Docker control groups (also known as cgroups), which let you set limits on how many resources each container can use. This will go a long way toward preventing container-based DoS attacks. 
   (Note, however, that cgroups aren't intended to help provide other security isolations between containers—to do that, you use namespaces.)
4) Use namespaces in Docker to isolate containers from one another. Namespaces help assure that a user or process running inside one container can't affect those in other containers.
5) Don't use images from repos you don't trust. In particular, avoid public repos if they're not from an official source and you don't know the maintainer. This may sound like a no-brainer, 
   but it's worth noting because it's sometimes so tempting to pull an image from a random registry.
6) Consider using Clair (CoreOS's container security scanner) to validate containers from your registries. You can use Clair to scan images locally or you can run it directly from public registry services that are supported 
  (which, for now, include CoreOS's own platform, Quay, as well as Dockyard).
